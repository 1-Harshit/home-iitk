The professor of PHY101A has decided to catch all cheating cases. Since you have already done that course, you decide to help him in this task by automating his work.

You are going to calculate the 'distance' between any 2 documents by counting the minimum number of operations (insertion, deletion or substitution) required to transform one document into the other.
For example,
- If one of the document is 'edit' and the other document is 'editor', the edit distance is 2 since we can remove 'or' from 'editor' to form 'edit'.
- If one of the document is 'doc1' and the other document is 'doc2', the edit distance is 1 since we can substitute '1' with '2' in 'doc1' to form 'doc2'.

Hint:
Let distance[m][n] denote the edit distance between first 'm' characters of document 1 and first 'n' characters of document 2. Then, we can construct a solution ground-up by observing that:
distance[m][n] = distance[m-1][n-1]   if  m^th character of document 1 is the same as n^th character of document 2
distance[m][m] = min(distance[m-1][n], distance[m][n-1], distance[m-1][n-1])+1    otherwise


Input Format:
Two integers ('n1' and 'n2') denoting the length of first and second document.
Content of first document ('n1' characters)
Content of second document ('n2' characters)
Output Format:
A single integer, the edit distance between the documents

Examples:

Input:
4 6
edit
editor

Output:
2
