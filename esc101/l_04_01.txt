                <div style="white-space: pre-wrap" class="statement">Satyam and Saurav are good friends, with a common enemy Shubhankar. 
Shubhankar always tries to read the messages which they send to each other.
Since Satyam is very smart, so he came up with the idea of encrypting his messages. 
He codes i(th) letter from the beginning of the English alphabet as i(th) character from the end. 
i.e., 'a' is coded as 'z', 'b' as 'y', etc.

<b>Note:</b> Spaces are not encoded, and only lower case alphabets are being used.
Since Satyam is smart, so he is busy. Thus he needs your help to encrypt the messages for him.

<b>Input:</b>
The first line of input contains a number n, the number of letters (including spaces) in the message.
The next line contains n space-separated letters, which form the message. (i.e., message "ab cd", will be given as "a b   c d", 
Note that, one space in the message is the same as three spaces in input)

<b>Output:</b>
Print the encrypted message. Only print the spaces, which are part of the message.

<b>Sample Input 1:  </b>
5
a b   c d
<b>Sample Output 1:</b>
zy xw

To be precise, Sample input 1 is: ['a', ' ', 'b', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'c', ' ', 'd']</div>
