Today is your First Flying class, and your first task is to command your broom to raise up to your hand.
Professor Rolanda Hooch has instructed that saying a “<b>Good Broom Number</b>” along with the command will increase your chances of succeeding.

A “<b>Good Broom Number</b>” is the smallest number greater than or equal to the number printed on the broom such that the (sum of digits of this number) and (1 + absolute difference of sum of digits at odd and even places respectively) both divide the number itself.

Suppose the number printed on the broom is 123, then the “<b>Good Broom Number</b>” for 123 is 126, since 126 is the smallest number greater than or equal to 123 such that its (sum of digits) i.e. 9 and (1 + absolute difference of sum of digits at odd and even places respectively) i.e. 6, both divide the number itself i.e. 126.

<b>INPUT</b>:
One line containing the number printed on the broom.

<b>OUTPUT</b>:
Print the line - <b>"result" up</b>
Where "result" is the Good Broom Number

<b>EXAMPLE</b>:

<b>INPUT</b>:
123

<b>OUTPUT</b>:
126 up

<b>Explanation</b>:
126 is the smallest number greater than or equal to 123 such that its (sum of digits) i.e. 9 and (1 + absolute difference of sum of digits at odd and even places respectively) i.e. (1 + (7 - 2)) = 6, both divide the number itself i.e. 126.
