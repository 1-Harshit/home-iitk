You are the tutor of course ESC101(hypothetically of course). You are given the task of grading quiz copies which have n questions and each question has a binary marking scheme(0 or 5). Your fellow tutor challenges you to write a program to print all the possibilities in which a student could answer and score in the quiz questions in the decreasing order of their decimal value. In return, your friend agrees to grade the copies assigned to you.

<b>INPUT</b>:
Integer n representing the number of questions in the quiz

<b>OUTPUT</b>:
All possibilities in which the student could score marks for each question in decreasing order of the decimal value of that number.

<b>EXAMPLE</b>:
Input :- 2
Output :- 
55
50
05
00
Explanation :- The student could score either 5 or 0 in the 2 quiz questions. The possibilities are printed in the decreasing order.

<b>Note:</b> Using recursion for this problem is mandatory.</div>
