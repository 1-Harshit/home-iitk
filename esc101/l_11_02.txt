To ‘civilise’ Mowgli, Shanti is trying to teach him the concept of numbers as invented by the humans in the village. She has brought him a bunch of square sized cue cards, each of which either has either a single 1 or a single 0 scribed on it. Being the naughty kid that Mowgli is, he glues all the pairs of zeros together. So now the cue cards represent either a single 1 (a square card) or two 0s (a rectangle card).

Shanti is not intending to give up so easily on him though. She asks him to count all possible binary sequences for a given length ‘N’ using these cue cards.

Help Mowgli figure out the math! SInce Mowgli’s a newbie, he is to report the answer modulo 12345. 

Input:
Integer n (1&lt;=n&lt;=100000)

Output:
Number of possible binary sequences

Example:
Input :-
2
Output :-
2

Explanation: 
Mowgli can make the sequence:
11 (using 2 square cards)
00 (using 1 rectangle card)

Input :-
4
Output :-
5

Explanation: 
Mowgli can make the sequence:
0000 (using 2 rectangle cards)
0011 (using 1 rectangle + 2 square cards)
1001 (using 1 rectangle + 2 square cards)
1100 (using 1 rectangle + 2 square cards)
1111 (using 4 square cards)
