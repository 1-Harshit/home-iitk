Given a structure for complex numbers(with integer parts), create functions for addition, multiplication and division of two complex numbers.
You will be given 2 complex numbers for whom you need to output the result of the arithmetic operations you implemented in the order stated above.
In case a part of a result is a non-integer, take its floor(floor of x  is the largest integer less than or equal to x ).
<b>INPUT</b>:
A complex no. "a + bi" is input as a b, i.e. real part and imaginary part separated by a space. 
The first line is the 1st complex no. 
The second line is the 2nd complex no. 

<b>OUTPUT</b>:
Addition result
Multiplication result
Division result
<b>EXAMPLE</b>:
INPUT: 
3 6
0 3
OUTPUT: 
3 9
-18 9
2 -1

<b>Note:</b> Must use the structure and functions provided in the initial template.
