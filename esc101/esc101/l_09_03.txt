Ritesh wants to create a token system where people are called according to the time they reached his office. Everyone gets a token when they reach his office, but Ritesh has not been to his office for a long long time. So there are many tokens which have timestamps on them in the form of Date-Month-Year Hour-Minute-Second across 20 years. We have to help him sort them in order of appearance. Create a structure timestamp which has two structures, date and time and write a function, Sort_Tokens to find the order in which they appear.

Date is a two digit number, Month is a two digit number denoting a month, Year is a four digit number, Hour is a number from 0 to 23 and Minute &amp; Second are numbers from 0 to 59.
Input:
Number of timestamps
Each timestamp in a new line in the format Date-Month-Year Hour-Minute-Second
Output:
Number of timestamps
Each timestamp in a new line in the format Date-Month-Year Hour-Minute-Second, but sorted

Example:
Input:
3
4 5 2005 23 10 50
4 4 2004 9 9 3
4 4 2004 9 10 3
Output:
3
4 4 2004 9 9 3
4 4 2004 9 10 3
4 5 2005 23 10 50
