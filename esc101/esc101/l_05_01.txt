Correct Output = 4+4+4+6+6+6 = 30 Marks total. 4 for each visible test case and 6 for each hidden test case.
<u>Note:</u> 0 marks would be given for visible test-cases if there is any form of hard-coding.  
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<b>Note:</b> 
<ul><li>This is a <u>functions</u> lab and you are expected to use functions (define and call) in all the questions</li>
<li>You need to implement the function <b>is_valid</b> which returns 1 is the date is valid and returns 0 if it is invalid, and call this function from your main function. Failure to implement this function will result in <b>zero</b> marks.</li>
<li>You are encouraged to create other functions as well to help you in the main task.</li>
<li>Usage of arrays is forbidden in this question (only concepts until loops/functions are allowed)</li></ul>

Given a date, determine if it is valid or not.

<b>NOTE:</b> Leap Years should be taken into account. A year is a leap year if
<ul>
<li>it is divisible by 400</li>
<li>Or it is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100</li>
</ul>

<b>INPUT</b>:
The input contains a single line with three space-separated integers corresponding to day, month and year respectively.

<b>OUTPUT</b>:
Output "Valid" if the date is valid, "Not Valid" otherwise.

<b>EXAMPLE</b>:
INPUT: 
30 2 2018
OUTPUT: 
Not Valid
Explanation:
The month of February does not have 30th day.
<b>Note:</b> Few marks will be reserved for good programming practices.
