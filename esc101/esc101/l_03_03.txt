                <div style="white-space: pre-wrap" class="statement">Luffy loves making patterns. However, he has been quite disinterested lately. Prof. Shunmukhraj wants him to stop being lazy and appreciate the beauty of programming. He comes up with an innovative solution and poses the following question to Luffy. Help Luffy escape this conundrum.

<b>Input:</b>
Integer n (1&lt;=n&lt;=10)

<b>Output:</b>
Print Triangular Pattern. Note that each line in output ends with a space. 

<b>Example:</b>
<b>Input:-</b>
4
<b>Output:-</b>
*
* *
* * *
* * * *

<b>Note:-</b> You are allowed to use only one loop at a time. If you use more than one loop (say a loop within a loop, like a nested loop), Prof. Shunmukhraj will get upset and cap your maximum score to 10 instead.

<b>Hint:-</b> Prof. Shunmukhraj will be really pleased if you use statements like continue and break.</div>
