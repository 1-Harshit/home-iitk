Aaishi loves playing FIFA against his best friend Ashay. Unfortunately, they have only one controller to play with, and neither of them wants to buy a new one. Since Aaishi is the clever one, so he comes up with a game, to trick Ashay into buying a new controller.
The game consists of a grid of size n*m, and each cell of the grid is a cost the player will have to incur if he steps on the cell.
Each player can choose the length of the step and has to step on every cell which is a multiple of the step_length.
The cells are numbered in the following fashion:-
The first row has cells numbered 1,2,3...m-1,m. Then the second row has cells numbered m+1,m+2,...2m-1,2m., and so on.
The score of a player is the total cost he incurs in the game, and the player getting a higher score wins, consequently, the loser will buy the controller.
Being very excited Ashay goes first and randomly chooses his step_length. Your task is to determine if Aaishi can beat Ashay in the game.

<b>Input Format :- </b>
The first line contains two integer n and m i.e., the dimensions of the grid.
The second line contains the step_length of Ashay.
And the next n lines contain m space-separated integers which are the costs of the cells in the grid.

<b>Output Format:-</b>
Print "YES" if Aaishi can win the game, else print "NO". Obviously without ".
