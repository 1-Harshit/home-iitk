Alice and Bob have decided to engage in a game. Alice has m available moves while Bob has n available moves. Both decide a move and play simultaneously. The result depends on the move pair chosen by the players. Now this is a zero sum game, meaning any gain by Alice results in an equal loss to Bob.
The outcome of each pair of moves(total n*m combinations) is known to both players in advance. Both players decide to come to truce if they can see that the best moves they make are same. The m*n matrix represents the score Alice gains from each move combination.
Alice knows that for every move she makes, Bob will try to minimize her score. So she takes the minimum for all rows and takes the maximum out of them to get the least score she can get. Similarly Bob knows that for every move he makes, Alice will try to maximize her score. So he calculates the maximum of all columns and takes the minimum of them to get the best score Alice can get. If the least and best scores are same, the players call a truce.
Given the scoring matrix, determine if truce is possible.
