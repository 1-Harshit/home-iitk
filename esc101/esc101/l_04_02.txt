You will be given 3 integers, the length of 3 lines and you will have to decide whether these 3 lines can form a triangle or not?
If they cannot form a triangle print "NO", otherwise print "YES", followed by the kind of triangle they will form, acute, right or obtuse-angled triangle, on the next line.
<b>Input Format:</b>
The first line of input is a single integer n, the number of test cases.
Next, n lines contain 3 integers a, b and c. The length of the 3 lines.

<b>Output Format:</b>
Mentioned above. *Note* that each word is printed on sepatare line.

<b>Sample Testcases:</b>

<b>Testcase 1:</b>

2 4 6
6 7 8
11 10 22
Output - 
NO
YES
Acute
NO

<b>Explanation for Testcase 1:</b>
In the first test, sides 3,4 and 5 will form a Right-angled triangle, so we will print "YES", followed by "Right" on the next line.
And in the second test, sides 1,2, and 3 cannot form a triangle, so we simply print "NO", on the next line.</div>
