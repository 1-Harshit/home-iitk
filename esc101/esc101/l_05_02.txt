Correct Output = 2.5+2.5+5+5+5+5+5+5 = 35 Marks total. 2.5 for each visible test case and 5 for each hidden test case.
<u>Note:</u> 0 marks would be given for visible test-cases if there is any form of hard-coding.

Tony Stark is trying to hack into Ultronâ€™s system but it has a heavy cryptographic lock. To solve it, he needs your help as he also wants to call Ms Potts. The first level is a simple lock which Nick Fury believes opens when we enter the number of ways the number on a lock can be written as a sum of prime numbers. You are away from all the fighting and cannot view the screen directly, but you decide to help and stand up for yourself. So you make a code which would give the answer to Tony when he enters the number displayed on the screen. Given a positive integer N, output the number of ways N can be expressed as a sum of two prime numbers. If there are no such prime pairs, output the word <i>None</i>.
Ultron does not differentiate between (p,q) and (q,p). 

e.g.
Input: 9
Output: 1
Explanation: 9 = 7 + 2

Input: 11
Output: None
Explanation: There is no pair (x,y) such that x+y=11 and x,y are prime.
