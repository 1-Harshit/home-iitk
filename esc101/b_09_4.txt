                <div style="white-space: pre-wrap" class="statement">Two rectangles are overlapping, if there is a point that is contained in both the rectangles (including boundaries). 
You must design a Structure corresponding to a rectangle. <b>You will be graded out of 10 if structs are not used</b>.
You need to figure out, whether given two axis-aligned rectangles overlap (i.e a rectangle is either horizontal or vertical <b> it is not tilted</b>). 

You are given a sequence of <b>n</b> rectangles. Each rectangle is denoted by the coordinates of it's <b>top left</b> and <b>bottom right point</b>. Each rectangle also has an <b>alphabet as a label</b>. The alphabetical label is from 'a'-'z' and must be assigned automatically in increasing order starting from 'a' as the coordinates are read. <b>You must output the labels of all overlapping pairs in the format label1,label2 such these pairs are printed in lexicographically increasing order. Output each pair only once. </b>

Constraints:
<b>2 &lt;= N &lt;= 26</b>
The coordinates of the rectangle's vertices are integers.
 
<b>Input Format: </b>
The first line consists of the number of rectangles <b>n</b>.
n lines of input follow containing 4 integers each - The x and y co-ordinates of the top-left point of the rectangle followed by the x and y co-ordinates of the bottom-right point of the rectangle.

<b>Output Format:</b>
label1, label2
label3, label4
...
