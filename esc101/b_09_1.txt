                <div style="white-space: pre-wrap" class="statement">Being an ESC101 student you have been given the task of generating a rank list for undergraduate students of IITK, by the academic section of IIT Kanpur. You are given a list of N students. The roll no. and marks in MTH101, PHY103 and ESC101 have been given for each student.


<b>The ranks are computed using the following rules:</b>

1. If total marks are different then the student with higher total gets a better rank
2. If total marks are same then a student with better marks in MTH101 gets a better rank
3. If both the above are same then a student with better marks in ESC101 gets a better rank
4. If all three of the above are same then a student with better marks in PHY103 gets a better rank
5. If all marks are same then either student can be given a better rank.

Assume that the roll no. and all the marks are integers. 

<b>You must use an appropriate struct to represent a student. You will be graded out of 10 if structs are not used.</b> 

<b>INPUT:</b>
The first line consists of an integer N; the number of students.
N lines of input follow each containing 4 integers in the following order - the roll no., marks in MTH101, marks in ESC101, marks in PHY103. 

<b>Constraints:</b>
Assume that N&gt;=1 

<b>OUTPUT:</b>
N lines of output in the format rank,roll no.
