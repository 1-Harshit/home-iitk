                <div style="white-space: pre-wrap" class="statement">We say that a matrix is good if there is a sub-matrix which is an identity matrix.  If a matrix is not good, then I say its goodness is 0. However, if it is good, we define goodness to be the dimension of largest identity sub-matrix of the given matrix (i.e. if identity sub-matrix is n x n, then the goodness is n). For example,

0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1
1 0 2 3

This matrix is good since 
1 0
0 1
is its sub-matrix and is identity. Since the dimension of the largest sub-matrix of the given matrix is 2, the goodness is 2.

Your task:
Given a matrix, print its goodness value and the location of the top left corner of the largest  identity sub-matrix. For the example given above, goodness value is 2 and location of the top left corner of the identity sub-matrix is (1,3) i.e. first row third column. If goodness is 0, then top left corner location may be taken as (-1,-1) since it is actually not defined.


Assume all numbers to be integer. If their are two or more largest identity sub-matrix with the location of top-left corner at (i1,j1) and (i2,j2), then output (i1,j1) if (i1 &lt; i2) or (i1 == i2 and j1 &lt; j2) , otherwise output (i2,j2).

Input:
m,n //denoting the number of rows and columns of the input matrix
followed by m x n matrix with m rows (each in a new line) and n columns
e.g.

3 4
0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1
1 0 2 3

Output:
g i j // if g is your goodness value and (i,j) is the location of the top left corner of the identity sub-matrix.

e.g. answer for the above input will be

2 1 3</div>
