Sudhistira goes to Yakuni's house to play cards. Each card has a character written on it. Sudhistira wants to ensure that Yakuni is not using a fake deck. He knows the contents of a correct deck. Help him verify the correctness of the Yakuni's deck.

You are given two integers n1 and n2 followed by two space separated strings of length n1 and n2 respectively, each consisting of lowercase characters (a - z). The length of each of the strings is not more than 500.
Output "yes" if the two decks are rearrangments of each other, "no" otherwise. (quotes are not to be printed)

Example 1: 
Input:
10 10
triangulan alanturing
Output:
yes

Example 2:
Input:
13 10
triangulation alanturing
Output:
no

Hint: Two strings are anagrams (rearrangements) if each character that occurs in the strings occurs an equal number of times in both.</div>
