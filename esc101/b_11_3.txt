The Government recently changed the whole currency system and introduced a new one. Given the denominations of currencies available in the new system, find the number of ways an ATM machine can generate notes for an entered amount N. Ideally, you will find a recursive solution for this question. Non-recursive solutions will get part marks. 

<b>Input:</b>
First line contains an integer <b>n</b> denoting the number of different denominations available in the new currency system.
Second line contains <b>n</b> space-separated integers denoting the denominations in <i>increasing</i> order.
Next line contains <b>t</b> denoting the number of test-cases.
Next line contains <b>t</b> integers, each representing the amount entered in the ATM.

<b>Output:</b>
For each of the <b>t</b> test-cases, output the number of ways the ATM machine can generate notes for the respective amount entered.

<b>Constraints:</b>
1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10
1 &lt;= denominations &lt;= 100
1 &lt;= t &lt;= 10
1 &lt;= amounts &lt;= 1000

<b>Sample Input:</b>
3
2 3 5
1
10

<b>Sample Output:</b>
4

<b>Explanation:</b>
The four possible note combinations which can be delivered by the ATM are as follows:
10 = 5 + 5
10 = 5 + 3 + 2
10 = 3 + 3 + 2 + 2
10 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2</div>
