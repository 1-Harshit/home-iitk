Vaibhav and Sagnik are perplexed by a problem they encountered while creating a face recognition software. They have a few circles they have identified in a picture and found out the x and y coordinates of their centers as well their radii. However, they want to know how many previously found circles have at least one point common to any new circle. It should be noted here that new circles would not be included in the previous circles after the number has been found. 

You would be given a number N, the number of circles already found. Then N lines would follow which each have three numbers: x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and the radius of the circle. These are the circles already confirmed by Vaibhav and Sagnik. The next line will have Q, which is the number of new circles for which we have to find the number of circles in the previously found circles with at least one point common. The next Q lines each have three numbers: x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and the radius of the circle for which we have to find the number of circles with at least a common point.

You have to create a struct Circle to store information for each line. Failure to do so will lead to 0 marks. You have to output Q lines in which each line has the number of circles in previously found circles that have at least one common point with the respective new circle.
<b>Grading Scheme</b>:
<b>Note:</b> Give 0 marks for test-case component if there is any form of hard-coding. Eg: printf("0"); 

<table class="table table-bordered">
	<tbody><tr><th>Marks</th> <th>Component</th></tr>
        
        
        <tr><td>+4</td> <td> for each visible passed test case </td></tr>
        <tr><td>+7</td> <td> for each hidden passed test case</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
INPUT:
Number of circles present
Each of those circles in a new line with the format x coordinate of centre,y coordinate of centre, radius. Each on a new line
Numbers of new circles
Each of those circles in a new line with the format x coordinate of centre,y coordinate of centre, radius. Each on a new line
OUTPUT:
for all of the new circles, print number of circles they have a common point with, each on a new line.

Example:
Input:
1
