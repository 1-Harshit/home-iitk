Rohit has designed a plagiarism detector that assigns unique integers to distinct submissions. If two students have the same submission, a same integer is assigned. The plagiarism detector returns a linked list of integers with all matching submissions clubbed together.  Rohit only wants to grade unique submissions and award zero to any copied submission. Given a linked list of integers assigned to submissions, help Rohit find out all unique submissions(integers).
<b>INPUT</b>:
First line contains <b>n</b> denoting the number of students.
Second lines contains n integers denoting the numbers assigned to each submission. <b>(All similar submissions appear together)</b>

<b>OUTPUT</b>:
A list of unique submissions.

<b>EXAMPLE</b>:
INPUT: 6
1 2 3 3 4 4
OUTPUT: 1-&gt;2
Explanation: Since 3 and 4 are repeated, those submissions will not be graded. Only unique submissions 1 and 2 are to be graded.

INPUT: 6
1 3 3 3 3 3
OUTPUT: 1
Explanation: Since 3 is repeated, those submissions will not be graded. Only unique submission 1 is to be graded.
