                <div style="white-space: pre-wrap" class="statement">Given a square matrix with integer entries, output the trace of the matrix if it is a diagonal matrix, output -1 if it is a non diagonal matrix.

<b>Diagonal matrix</b> - A diagonal matrix is a square matrix in which the entries outside the main diagonal are all zero.

<b>Trace of a square matrix</b> - Trace of a square matrix is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal of the matrix.


<b>INPUT</b>:
Integer n representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix
followed by a n x n matrix with n rows (each in a new line) and n columns

<b>OUTPUT</b>:
Trace of the matrix if the matrix is diagonal, -1 otherwise.

<b>EXAMPLE</b>:
Input :-
3
1 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 3
Output :- 6
Explanation :- The matrix is diagonal with trace = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Hence, the output is 6.</div>
