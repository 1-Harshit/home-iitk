                <div style="white-space: pre-wrap" class="statement">Given an array A of N integers and M swap operations, you must print the final state of the array.

For each pair of indices (i,j) of the array A, you must swap  A[i] and A[j]. 

Any use of arrays ( even for declaration ) will fetch you 0 marks.


Input Format:
First line contains N  - the number of input instances
For each input instance
First line contains n and m, where n is the size of integer array A and m is the number of triplet sort operations.
Second line contains N integers of the array A.
Each of the next M lines contains two integers corresponding to a swap.

Output Format:
You must print N comma separated integers corresponding to the final array A after all M sort operations.

Example:

Given Input:
2
5 2
9 5 6 0 3
0 1
1 2
4 1
4 7 1 2
1 2

Expected Output:
5 6 9 0 3
4 1 7 2</div>
