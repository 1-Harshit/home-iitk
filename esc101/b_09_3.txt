                <div style="white-space: pre-wrap" class="statement">Your first task today is to write a program to do add two float values. Sounds simple enough? The catch is that you have to take in both numbers from the command line.

<b>Hint:</b>You are allowed to use <b>atof</b> function from stdlib.h which converts a float string to float.

char num[] = "3.14";
float n = atof(num); // num = 3.14

<b> NOTE :</b>  This program has a two part evaluation process. Please <b> first </b> write the program and make it pass all test cases on Prutor, hidden and visible. <b> Second </b>, download the code and modify it. Your code must be compiled and executed on your local system, in the presence of a TA. The TA will verify that your program runs the way it should, and note your Roll number as well as submission down. For Online Semester: Student have to check it by themselves for the evaluation part.

<b> OFFLINE EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS: </b> You will be required to execute all possible operations, while taking input from command line. 

Command to execute : "./a.out X Y OP", where X and Y are integers and OP is the required operation.

INPUT:
Prutor : The input will contain three lines. Each line will contain an float of arbitrary length (not more than 100 digits). 
Offline : The command line arguments will contain three floating point integers. 
OUTPUT:
Output one line, which should be the result of adding both the floats and print till the <b>last two decimal places</b>.

EXAMPLE:
INPUT:
7.09
6.01

OUTPUT: 
13.10

<b>Note:</b> Few marks will be reserved for good programming practices.</div>
